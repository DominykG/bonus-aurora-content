		<description>
			<p class="flavor">Yells and chuckles are common sounds around the home of any rakin thanks to their shared love language: pranks. From sewerside burrows to palatial penthouses, wattle-and-daub huts to intricate treetop villages, rakin can be found at all levels of society, a product of their ingeniousness and habit of getting into trouble. One is rarely bored around a rakin.</p>
			<h4>DEIFIC ORIGINS</h4>
			<p>The mistaken spawn of a passionate tryst between deities of trickery and nature, rakin hold a deep affinity for both domains. Since their creation, they have had little contact with either god, learning to rely on their own wits to survive.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Trickery.</b> As rakin society progressed, their culture grew to value trickery and subterfuge. Good-natured pranks sprang from their paws as instinctively as breathing. Honed against the fearsome beasts of the forest, this innate talent to deceive helped the rakin bloom as a civilisation. Tales are still told of how Mack Gyver fought off a rampaging owlboar with nought but a goodberry, a silver needle, and a pig’s bladder.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Pranks.</b> Rakin politics, religion, and interpersonal relationships revolve around the idea of practical jokes. An atmosphere of one-up-manship and lighthearted merriment suffuses all of their wheelings and dealings. Even when faced with the most horrid of circumstances, a rakin’s first instinct is to crack a joke.</p>
			<h4>IDEOLOGICAL CHASM</h4>
			<p>After centuries of living in chaotic mirth, an ideological battle split rakin culture in two when they first made contact with other humanoids. Many of the rakin were intrigued by cities—forests of stone and steel, organized yet unpredictable, and full of opportunity. The elders forbade them to interact, alleging such civilization to be directly counter to the chaos that nature intended, the principle upon which rakin culture was built.</p>
			<p class="indent">The debacle spiraled into a full-on feud between the opposing rakin factions, sundering the once united race. The urkin broke with tradition and followed their ambition into the cities, whilst the tanukin remained in their indigenous forests, adhering to their ancestral ways.</p>
			<h4>RAKIN NAMES</h4>
			<p>Rakin naming conventions differ greatly between the urkin and tanukin subraces, whose cultural structures irrevocably changed after the schism.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Urkin.</b> Eager to fit in, urkin have adopted the first and last name format of other humanoid races. Typically, an urkin will name themselves, taking the name of a well known figure, and wringing from it the most humorous pun imaginable. Urkin pride themselves on having the cleverest name they know, and will go through dozens in their lifetime.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Posskin.</b> The words used to name a posskin are more than just sounds; they are a story. A posskin’s name recounts its journey so far, a litany of major life events since birth. The more adventurous the life, the longer the name. The name Leo Charrburned Halfleg might specify a young (and unfortunate) posskin born under the sign of the lion, who was burned in a forest fire, and later lost their lower leg to a bear.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Tanukin.</b> With deeper ties to their ancestry, tanukin stick to one name over the course of their lifetime. Tanukin regard family with uncharacteristic solemnity; their names are a portmanteau of their caregivers’. Because of this, gender plays little to no role in their naming conventions.</p>

			<p>Urkin society values cunning, savvy, and–above all–the thrill of the heist. This leaves the urkin with a bit of a nasty reputation, a fact that utterly fails to curb their ambitions. Adaptable and resourceful, urkin excel as confidence tricksters and pickpockets.</p>

			<p>Tanukin believe that civilization is a sacrilegious destruction of the beautiful chaos of nature. So rarely do tanukin venture into humanoid settlements that they are often mistaken for racoons, or worse, urkin. The times they do deign to enter the ‘stone forests’, it is to use their illusion magic to evoke the divine chaos and confusion that they associate with the natural world.</p>

			<p>While the tanukin and urkin found homes in forests and cities, a third, smaller contingent embraced their wanderlust and a life of vagabondry. With the road as their home, posskin never settle in one place for long and are well adapted to the harsh conditions associated with constantly sleeping outdoors.Their ability to withstand disease enables them to act as scavengers, feasting on the left-to-rot remains of other carnivores. Should they ever find themselves the target of a territorial creature, their innate ability to play dead can often trick such aggressors into believing they are no longer a threat and leaving them alone, if a little bloodied.</p><p>Posskin might find employ in a variety of walks of life. From hedge knights to circus performers, travelling snake oil salesmen to chronic dumpster divers, so long as the job keeps moving, a posskin stays happy.</p>
