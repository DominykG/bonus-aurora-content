			<p>If leather is a material, then why not skin itself? Students of the College of Fleshweaving make works of art out of weeping wounds, transform disfigurement into displays of transcendent beauty, and mould flesh into innovative adaptations inspired by the flora and fauna around them. A fleshweaver bard down on their luck might find employment as a battlefield surgeon, while the epitome of a fleshweaver’s career is to be the chief facemaker to royalty, altering their visage and physiology through biomantic rituals and deft needlework.</p>

			<p>3rd-level College of Cuisine feature.</p>
			<p>Years spent mending, shaping, and adapting flesh have given you a preternatural ability to modify your own body. You are proficient with surgeon’s tools, which you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you know the alter self spell, which counts as a bard spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of bard spells you know. Over the course of 1 minute, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot, choosing only the Change Appearance option. When you cast the spell in this way, it doesn’t require concentration.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, over the course of 10 minutes, you can use your surgeon’s tools to change the appearance of a willing creature. It magically gains the benefits of the Change Appearance effect of the alter self spell, which lasts until it finishes a long rest. After you use your surgeon’s tools in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
