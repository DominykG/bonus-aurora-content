# bonus-aurora-content
Additional books for aurora builder for personal use.

Put all the files (except portraits) into the `C:\Users\<Your User>\Documents\5e Character Builder\custom\user`

Portraits should go into `C:\Users\<Your User>\Documents\5e Character Builder\portraits`

(Assuming you are using default Aurora configuration)

## Notable fats:
<ul>
    <li>Due to Aurora character sheet limitation and sheer size of some Race and Class features, some of them were created as cantrips with <b>*</b> prefix so that they would show up on the top of your spellcards. Features that have been modified in this way have that fact stated in the Traits boxes.</li>
</ul>
